## 0.1.0 — source preview

- Native small and medium macOS widgets, with English and Simplified Chinese.
- Side-by-side 5-hour and weekly **used** percentages.
- Separate day/hour/minute reset countdowns.

Known limitations: source builds require full Xcode and Node; no notarized binary; WidgetKit refresh is system-scheduled; clean-machine installation and Intel support need more validation; the optional third-party feed may lag or fail.
